            <p>
                Have you ever wanted to get a live headcount of what was
                happening at your university? We did, and developed Unispaces to
                connect students and let them know what was happening! With
                Unispaces, you can find out how loud it is in the library, if
                there are any spaces left in the Commuter lot, or how loud the
                study lounge is! Try our app today!

            <h1>The Creators</h1>
            <p>
                Aaron Woolfolk, Jonathan Daniel and Tahj Anderson are the
                original developers of this app. They created this app during
                the 2021 Hack GT hackathon, and are excited to keep working on
                and seeing where this goes next! Each of these students are B.S.
                Computer Science majors at Clemson University. They are expected
                to graduate in May 2023, and want to continue working with
                Computer Science in their future careers. You can connect with
                them at LinkedIn at the links below!
